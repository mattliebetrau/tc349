Dribbble Notes

I love how the colors are being used to create not only a beautiful night scene but a sense of wonder as well. The green in the sky is surreal - letting us know there is a bit of mysticism involved. The shadow of the foreground lets the background stand out and frames everything nicely. I don't agree with the choice to make the buildings such standout colors. They draw too much attention when in fact they aren't that important to the picture.

My favorite thing about this picture is the use of the hand's form by the artist to frame the landscape. The sand occupies the palm and the mountain and sky are in the fingers. The breaking point between where the fingers begin and the palm ends represents the horizon. The tree on the thumb is a nice subtle touch. My only complaint is that the colors are a bit dull. I understand the landscape doesn't give a lot of opportunities for vibrant colors but the colors being used are really underwhelming.

I have to admit something; my love for Star Wars may have had a small influence on my decision to choose this. However, I do really enjoy a lot about this picture. I like that the artist managed to find a balance between simplicity and complexity. You can see all the intricacies in the Millennium Falcon but it doesn't look cluttered. I like how the ship extends past the canvas, really making it the focus. I don't think the planets are necessary here. I would prefer if those spaces were just uniformly black with specs like the rest of the image so the ship was framed more evenly.
